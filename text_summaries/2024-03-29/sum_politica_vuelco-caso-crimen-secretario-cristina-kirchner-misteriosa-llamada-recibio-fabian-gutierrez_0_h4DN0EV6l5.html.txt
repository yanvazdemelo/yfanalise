A recent investigation by the Gendarmerie National has revealed that Fabián Gutiérrez, the former private secretary of Cristina Kirchner, received a last phone call before his assassination in El Calafate in July 2020. The call was made to an unknown person who left Santa Cruz. This information was uncovered during the ongoing trial of the case, which began on March 18th and is expected to conclude next Friday.

The investigation into Gutiérrez's phone has been a mystery for years, with no data recovered from the device. The Gendarmerie National attempted to recover data from the iPhone twice, but was unsuccessful both times. Despite this setback, the police were able to detain three individuals in connection to the case and found Gutiérrez's body semi-buried.

The lack of information on Gutiérrez's phone has only added to the list of unanswered questions surrounding his assassination. Who was the last person he spoke to? What was the content of their conversation? These questions remain unanswered, leaving the case still shrouded in mystery.
