A notícia que eu escolhi para resumi-la é a seguinte:
"O NASA lançou uma missão para explorar um asteroide próximo da Terra"

Resumo:
O NASA recently launched a mission to explore an asteroid near Earth. The mission, called OSIRIS-REx, will study the asteroid Bennu and bring back samples for further analysis. This is the first time NASA has attempted to retrieve samples from an asteroid, and the mission could provide valuable insights into the formation of our solar system.

Detalhes:
The OSIRIS-REx mission launched on September 8th and will take approximately two years to reach Bennu. Once the spacecraft arrives at the asteroid, it will use a robotic arm to collect samples from the surface and then return to Earth. Scientists hope that the mission will reveal information about the composition of Bennu and how it has changed over time. Additionally, the mission could provide insights into the potential hazards of asteroids and how they might be deflected if they were on a collision course with Earth.
