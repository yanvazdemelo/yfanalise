The Brazilian Central Bank (BC) has reduced the Selic interest rate for the sixth time in a row, this time by 0.50 percentage points to 10.75% per year. This decision was unanimous among the nine members of the Monetary Policy Committee (Copom), including the four appointed by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The BC justified the decision by understanding that it is compatible with the strategy of converging inflation to the target range over the relevant horizon, which includes 2024 and 2025. The BC also emphasized the need for serenity and moderation in conducting monetary policy, given the current challenging global scenario.

According to the Copom's communiqué, the current situation, characterized by a slower pace of disinflation, justifies the need for a contractionary monetary policy to consolidate the process of disinflation and anchor inflation expectations. The BC also reiterated its commitment to persevering with a contracionary monetary policy until the process of disinflation is consolidated, not only in terms of the inflation rate but also in terms of the anchoring of inflation expectations.

The decision of the BC was widely expected by the financial market, as it had signaled at its last meeting that a 0.50 percentage point cut would be appropriate in the "near future". The BC also emphasized that the new measure will help to reduce the uncertainty of the current scenario and provide more clarity for the market. Despite the decision, Brazil still has one of the highest real interest rates in the world, second only to Mexico, and the country's inflation expectations remain above the target range.
